# Web Extension Development Plan

## Overview
Create a Chrome extension that automates job application form filling by:
1. Collecting user resume and additional information
2. Scraping job application pages
3. Using LLM to intelligently fill form fields
4. Supporting multiple job application websites

## Technical Components

### 1. Extension Structure
- manifest.json (Extension configuration)
- Background Script (Handles core functionality)
- Content Script (Page interaction)
- Popup UI (User interface)
- Storage (User data management)

### 2. User Data Collection
- Resume upload functionality
  - Support for PDF, DOCX, TXT formats
  - Parse resume to extract key information
- Additional information form
  - Custom questions based on common job application fields
  - Store user preferences and answers
- Secure storage of user data
  - Encrypt sensitive information
  - Local storage for user data

### 3. Page Scraping
- Content script to analyze job application pages
- Identify form fields and their types
- Map field labels to user data
- Handle dynamic form loading
- Support for multiple form layouts

### 4. LLM Integration
- API integration with LLM service
- Prompt engineering for form filling
- Context management
  - Combine user data with page context
  - Handle field-specific requirements
- Error handling and validation

### 5. Form Filling
- Automated field population
- Validation of filled data
- User review and confirmation
- Manual override options
- Progress tracking
